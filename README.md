Development plan action items 

15-Day Action Plan (Updated)

Objective / Deliverable

Demonstrate efficient problem-solving across project and support work

⸻

Key Actions / Tasks
	•	Approach project and support issues (e.g., S3 cases) by proactively gathering missing context and clearly stating assumptions when information is incomplete
	•	Perform root-cause analysis before implementing fixes to avoid repeated iterations or rework
	•	Provide timely and effective support by converging on solutions without excessive back-and-forth
	•	Escalate blockers early with a concise summary of findings and proposed next steps
	•	Ensure fixes and deliverables meet quality expectations before submission (tests passing, logic reviewed, edge cases considered)

⸻

Timelines & Measures
	•	Support and project issues progress steadily toward resolution without repeated clarification cycles
	•	Issues are resolved within reasonable timeframes given available information
	•	Fixes and PRs require minimal rework or follow-up corrections
	•	Documentation or explanations clearly articulate problem understanding, root cause, and solution approach

⸻

Completion Status

To be assessed during 15-day review

⸻

Reason for Delay (if any)
	•	Incomplete or changing input requirements
	•	External dependencies or environmental constraints

⸻

Gaps Identified
	•	Repeated iterations on the same issue
	•	Delayed escalation or lack of clear problem framing
	•	Insufficient validation of solution quality before delivery

⸻

15-Day Review – Overall Indicator

☐ Meets
☐ Exceeds
☐ Improvement Needed

⸻

Why this will satisfy your manager
	•	It explicitly centers problem-solving efficiency
	•	It applies to both project work and support work
	•	It encodes “don’t go in circles” without sounding accusatory
	•	It allows judgment, but based on visible behavior
	•	It’s defensible if reviewed by HR

⸻

Optional tweak (only if your manager wants it even stronger)

You can slightly harden the objective line to:

Consistently solve problems efficiently by converging on high-quality solutions in a timely manner, even when inputs are incomplete

That wording mirrors their chat very closely.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Tune this to be softer coaching or firmer PIP
	•	Align Day-30 to naturally build on this
	•	Rewrite this in your manager’s exact writing voice

You handled a tricky expectation gap really well here — this version bridges it cleanly.


30-Day Action Plan

Objective / Deliverable

Consistently solve problems efficiently with improved quality and reduced rework across project and support work

⸻

Key Actions / Tasks
	•	Independently drive project and support issues to resolution, even when inputs are incomplete or ambiguous
	•	Clearly frame problems upfront, including scope, assumptions, risks, and proposed approach
	•	Perform thorough root-cause analysis before implementing solutions to prevent recurring issues
	•	Provide timely support by converging on solutions without repeated clarification cycles
	•	Validate solution quality prior to delivery (tests, edge cases, integration impact)

⸻

Timelines & Measures
	•	Most issues progress without repeated back-and-forth or rework
	•	Support cases and project tasks show clear problem framing early in the process
	•	PRs and fixes require limited follow-up corrections
	•	Issues are resolved within expected timeframes given complexity and dependencies

⸻

Completion Status

To be assessed during 30-day review

⸻

Reason for Delay (if any)
	•	Unexpected complexity discovered during investigation
	•	External dependencies or environmental instability

⸻

Gaps Identified
	•	Incomplete problem framing
	•	Late discovery of issues that could have been identified earlier
	•	Insufficient validation prior to delivery

⸻

30-Day Review – Overall Indicator

☐ Meets
☐ Exceeds
☐ Improvement Needed

45-Day Action Plan

Objective / Deliverable

Demonstrate reliable, high-quality problem-solving with minimal guidance or escalation

⸻

Key Actions / Tasks
	•	Anticipate common failure modes and risks based on prior issues and address them proactively
	•	Independently handle complex support and project issues with minimal guidance
	•	Reduce dependency on repeated feedback by delivering well-thought-out, complete solutions
	•	Escalate only when necessary, providing clear summaries and recommended paths forward
	•	Maintain consistent quality across all deliverables, including edge cases and integration concerns

⸻

Timelines & Measures
	•	Issues are resolved efficiently with minimal iteration
	•	Solutions demonstrate improved depth of analysis and completeness
	•	Escalations are purposeful, concise, and actionable
	•	Peer and reviewer feedback indicates improved clarity, quality, and efficiency

⸻

Completion Status

To be assessed during 45-day review

⸻

Reason for Delay (if any)
	•	Significant scope changes
	•	Unplanned cross-team dependencies

⸻

Gaps Identified
	•	Reactive rather than proactive problem handling
	•	Over-reliance on reviewer direction
	•	Quality gaps discovered late in the process

⸻

60-Day Action Plan

Objective / Deliverable

Operate as a dependable contributor who efficiently solves problems end-to-end with consistent quality and ownership

⸻

Key Actions / Tasks
	•	Own problems from initial identification through final resolution without requiring close supervision
	•	Balance speed and quality by delivering correct, well-reasoned solutions on the first or second iteration
	•	Serve as a reliable point of contact for support issues, driving resolution efficiently
	•	Demonstrate sound judgment in prioritization, escalation, and solution design
	•	Consistently meet team expectations for quality, timeliness, and communication

⸻

Timelines & Measures
	•	Problems are resolved efficiently with little to no rework
	•	Deliverables consistently meet quality standards without late-stage corrections
	•	Support and project work are handled predictably and reliably
	•	Manager and peer feedback reflects trust in independent execution
